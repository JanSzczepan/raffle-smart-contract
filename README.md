# Smart Contract Raffle
Getting to know the world of blockchain and Web 3.0, I created a decentralized lottery. The project was developed in a professional Ethereum environment - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) . Smart Contract is built using Solidity, while staging and unit tests (which are extremely important, especially in blockchain programming) using JavaScript. To draw a lottery winner in a decentralized periodic manner, I used [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction) and [Chainlink Keepers](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/introduction) technology.

## Technologies used to make this project

This decentralized smart contract raffle was created with **Solidity**, **JavaScript**, **Hardhat** and **Chainlink**.
